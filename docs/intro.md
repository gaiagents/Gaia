# Gaia Intro

GAIA AI—short for the Guild of Altruistic Interoperable Agents—envisions a collaborative network of agentic intelligences driving the transition to a more regenerative, equitable, and thriving world. By merging advanced AI technologies with decentralized governance and purposeful funding mechanisms, GAIA AI aspires to become a powerful steward of planetary health and resilience. This greenpaper synthesizes the essential ideas, technical roadmap, and philosophical ethos found in the GAIA AI working documentation, offering a comprehensive vision for how AI can serve as a catalyst for ecological and social regeneration.
